# Bang-Controller-Project
Bang Bang controller for a moving mass

I tuned the PI controller, to get the Bang-bang effect.

At the beginning I got discretization error but with the right tuning I got it! the next step is to program the controller using Dynamics Programming techniques, which are much more advanced, but computationally expensive.

# Bang-Controller-Project
Bang Bang controller for a moving mass

I tuned the PI controller, to get the Bang-bang effect.
At the beginning I got discretization error but with the right tuning I got it!

The next step would be to try: Dynamics Programming techniques, which are much more advanced, but computationally expensive.
